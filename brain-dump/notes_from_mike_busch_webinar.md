horsepower linear relationship with fuel dlow

GPH * 14.9


carson’s min fuel flow for knot of air speed
32% more speed for 16% more fuel
it’s a 52% increase in power but 24% decrease in flight time
max L/D only optimizes fuel flow

JPI MPG
Rule absolute minimum an hour of fuel in the tank. If 

LOP, neither RPM OR MP determine power. &.5:1 compression 

climb time to cruise time efficient (?)

for short legs what do we do


too rich = nasty exhaust deposits

airspeed cube root of power

climb function of excess horsepower so HP is useful 

ROP power RPM x MP

how to lean for best power 


5% airspeed for 20% less fuel good deal. 

20% excess fuel for 1.5% TAS, best power doesn’t make much sense.

again, why is full rich abusive during landing? ERAU?


why is low RPM good?

why is WOT good?

fuel flow?

should i be picking an air speed or a % power to fly? how do i choose an RPM/FF to maintain an airspeed?

if a prop is spinning at a constant speed then how does changes in manifold effect flying characteristics? the prop isn’t spinning and slower or faster? what’s different?

determine e

here are the airspeeds
