55% power should be 55% power regardless of best power or best economy mixture.

so what this is really saying is some arbitrary power setting at fuel flow X

How can 65% power at different mixtures yield different results? Makes no sense.

Also, how would fuel flow = power to be produced. The fuel flow you’d produce 65% power at best power vs. best economy would be different.

Different Fuel Ratio
Best Power: Less MP, Greater Fuel Ratio
Best Economy: More MP, Less Fuel Ratio, Less Fuel Flow

You’d think more MP would give it a higher fuel flow. Not true. More MP gives it an overall greater quantity of the fuel to air mixture.

So you need more fuel to air mixture to produce 65% power at a best economy ratio. However, even with the greater quantity of the mixture, you still end up using less fuel.
