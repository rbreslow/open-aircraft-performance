I cancelled IFR while I was still in the Class B. I was told to squwak VFR and change frequencies.

In a chatroom with an air traffic controller: 

- “If you were in the bravo under IFR then you were cleared in. It's part of your IFR clearance. If you canceled IFR and you're still in the bravo I'd say you're still cleared in”
- “But I don't work bravo airspace and I'm not an FAA lawyer so it depends who you ask”

There's no requirement to squawk anything in a Class B, just a requirement to be cleared in.
