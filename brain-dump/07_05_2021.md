As previously pointed out, proper fuel regulation depends on the ability of the carburetor to measure correctly the weight of air flowing through it. If altitude or temperature are increased, the same weight of air will occupy a greater volume, and thus will flow through the carburetor with a higher velocity. This has the effect of increasing the fuel metering forces. The simple airflow measuring device of the non-automatic carburetor does not fully compensate for this extra force, with the results that the mixture becomes richer as temperature or altitude is increased.

Non-automatic carburetor but does the Lance have a non-automatic fuel injection system?
