Comfortable in the system. Comfortable flying IFR. Comfortable flying flight plans. Then comfortasble flying in actual.

I want to be able to fly in minimums.


Experience in take offs, landings, between minimums and 1000s.

1-2-3 Alternate. 1 hr before eta, 1 hour after, 2000 3sm. 600-2 for precision, 800-2 non precision.

Personal minimums. I’d want an out. With another pilot with me.

It changes in a hurry. One radio call, lost primary and alternate.

Day to night, fog will start. Temperature drops to dew point. Not getting better before it gets worse.

You can’t trust forecast. Monitor your out along the way. See how the forecasts are changing. If NY, Baltimore, to Harrisburg, are below IFR. You don’t launch.

2 pilots. While you’re flying missed, Tom can easily put it in.

Actual occurs because of weather phenomenon. For the most part, as long as straight and level, you’re OK.

- be familiar
- be out with 500’ ceilings
- I know how to fly in the system.
- I don’t know what my minimums would be yet, because I haven’t had a real opportunity without my instructor. It’d depend on where my outs are. 1000ft to start.
