I know the Dakota has a non-automatic carburetor, but does the Lance have a non-automatic fuel injection system?

POH gives fuel flows for 65% power, 75% power, at best economy and best power. There’s a single power setting table. How can that be? 65% power would require more MP at best economy mixture. Also, how is there a single fuel flow? You’re adjusting the mixture at every altitude to maintain the same ratio. It gets leaner and leaner. 

You’d think more MP would give it a higher fuel flow. Not true. More MP gives it an overall greater quantity of the fuel to air mixture.

So you need more fuel to air mixture to produce 65% power at a best economy ratio. However, even with the greater quantity of the mixture, you still end up using less fuel.
