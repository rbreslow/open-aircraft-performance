1. I would like to see an intersection of the L/D curves of the Lance so I can articulate why Carson's Speed makes sense, why best range speed makes sense, and why, as a club, we will all lose by using arbitrary percentages of horsepower.

1. Can I design a graphic that will show the most efficient way to operate the plane? Or write an algorithm? e.g. the intersection of:
    - Manifold Pressure & Wide Open Throttle
    - RPM
    - Mixture & Air/Fuel Ratio
    - Airspeed (think: best range, Carson's Speed, etc.)

1. Mike Busch says the dual mags are just related to the accessory case. Rather than have to swap for a whole new engine, can we just get a new accessory case?

1. Why is 100 F ROP better than Peak EGT? Could still be dangerous, especially if a cylinder decides to be 50F lower (which I've seen on the Dakota). Just seems like less of a chance of vibration.

1. How do you know VOR will have signal coverage to get on the airway? 

1. What happens to CHTs when I’m at best power and adjust RPM? Best economy and adjust RPM?

1. What happens to CHTs at constant RPM, full rich, and I close throttle during a climb? Close RPM?

1. if you’re off airway routing and you lose radio/radar can you still do it? OROCA aren’t guaranteed, so i assume it’s all MVA? but you don’t have MVA in the plan

1. "Indicated airspeed will be less than it would be with the CG in the most rearward allowable position." Explain this statement. Graph it with real data.

1. Fuel flow (e.g., GPH) will increase if you increase throttle, but air/fuel ratio will remain the same. Fuel flow is increasing because there's a larger "charge" being sucked into the cylinders.

5. How can 65% power at different mixtures yield different results? Makes no sense.
