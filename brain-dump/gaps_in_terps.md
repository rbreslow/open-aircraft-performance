### How can I assure obstacle clearance from the runway to my first enroute waypoint?

Guarantees:

The ICA (initial climb area) is always protected.

1) Was the runway assessed for **unrestricted** diverse departure?

Definitions:

RCL -> runway center line
DRP -> departure reference point -> established on RCL 2000 feet from the start end of the runway.

You have:
- a 25 NM radius from the DRP, assuming you've climbed to 400ft MSL above the DER.

2) Do OCS penetrations prevent unrestricted diverse departure?

- Departure instructions will assure the aircraft will maneuver clear of the prohibited sector boundaries.

Operational requirements may necessitate a higher climb gradient. When an obstacle penetrates the 40:1 OCS within the departure sector OEA, establish a climb gradient and climb gradient termination altitude.

Consider constructing sectors. They'd prefer not increasing climb gradient, however, operational requirements may require that. If you have an obstacle penetrate the OCS, then establish a climb gradient.

We're taking off using Rwy 35 at KAVL. We've filed KAVL AVL7 SOT V136 VXV KTYS. /A, so no RNAV. And, theroetically, no ATC contact. 

We're flying the Asheville 7 Departure. We have to climb on a heading of 347Â° to 8000'. It'll take us 30 NM to reach 8000', assuming we climb at 490' per NM to 3500', and then 200' per NM to 8000.

If we can perform a diverse climb at the top of the SID, I think we can assure obstacle clearance to the NAVAID. If the radials are usable, then we could hop on V136.

Do you know how I can get "fly runway heading" on departure if there's not a DVA? Is it that, the area was surveyed for diverse departure, so they're just having me fly straight out until I get to the MVA?
